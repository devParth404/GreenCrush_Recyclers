# GreenCrush_Recyclers
Green Crush Recyclers is a small-scale sustainable recycling initiative focused on converting waste glass into glass powder and cullet. The project reduces landfill waste, promotes reuse of glass, and supplies locally produced recycled material to construction and manufacturing industries, supporting a circular economy in India.
